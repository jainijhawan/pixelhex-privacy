## How to Use in App Store Connect

### Method 1: App-Level Support URL (Recommended)
1. Go to **App Store Connect** → Your App
2. Navigate to **App Information**
3. Find **Support URL** field
4. Enter: `https://[your-username].github.io/pixelhex-privacy/support.html`

This single URL will work for all localizations since users can access localized versions through links within the page.

### Method 2: Per-Localization Support URLs (Optional)
If App Store Connect allows different support URLs per localization:
1. Go to each localization in App Store Connect
2. Use the corresponding support URL from the table above
3. English variants (UK, Canada, Australia) can all use the same `support.html`
4. Language variants (e.g., French France/Canada) can share the same file

Once you've pushed to GitHub and enabled GitHub Pages:
