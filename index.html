        <h2>5. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>

        <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>

        <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>

        <h2>12. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
